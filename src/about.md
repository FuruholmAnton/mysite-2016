      About me
    </h2>
    <p class="sectionHeader_text">My name is Anton Furuholm and I'm the creator of this website. Creating site is my life as a web developer. I worked at an agency <a href="//grandpublic.se" target="_blanck" class="link">Grand Public</a>, but I'm soon heading out on adventures traveling with my bicycle.</p>

        <p>I'm from a lovely country called Sweden. Living deep in the green woods in a small town called Eksjö known for its old wooden buildings.</p>

        <p>The reason I started programming websites was due to many reasons but before I ever got my eye on it I had my eyes on programming robots. That may sound cool and it was, but after a year in university, I decided I had to change life course. With a background of making art, programming cool robots didn't really satisfy me. Ironically, I search the web for what could be my future direction and that's when I found something that offered both art and programming, Graphic Design and Web Development. To start studying that was probably one of the most successful and important decisions in my life. It quickly became my new and greatest hobby. Developing for the web.</p>

        <p>I am what's called a front-end developer. I work mostly with programming languages called HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. But I’ve also worked with back-end languages such as MySQL, noSQL, PHP on the back-end, and some NodeJS. I also work with content management systems, such as Wordpress and recently Kirby.</p>

        <p>If you would like to know more about what I have done check out my <a href="https://github.com/FuruholmAnton" target="_blanck" class="link">Github page</a> where you can see the code behind some of my personal projects.</p>

        <h4>Photography</h4>
        <p>Photography has been a big interest since I was young. but it was not until I undertook a course on photography at my university that I realized my passion for it. I bought my first DSLR and started shooting at everything and everyone. I think I'm very fortuned to have acquired this interest because it has helped me see the world in a new perspective. I have started to see things that I didn't notice of before. </p>

        <p>This site, furuholm.com, was built using static HTML files that were created by a generator named <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="link" target="_blanck">Jekyll</a>. The reason for using static HTML and not a CMS was mostly because of security reasons and also to make it a bit faster, due to not having to render anything on the server before sending the files to the user.

        Because I like to build my own plugins and libraries I haven't used many created by other developers. But I do know my limits and I don't want to invent the wheel again if I can't make it better. For this site, I’ve tried using a plugin from <a href="http://greensock.com/ScrollToPlugin" class="link" target="_blanck">GreenSock.com</a> to make animations more durable and less buggy.
