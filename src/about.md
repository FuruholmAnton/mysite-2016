        <p>This site is built with static HTML files using a generator called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="link" target="_blanck">Jekyll</a>. I chose this to make the site more secure and fast.

        I have chosen to avoid using plugins and libraries as much as possible. For this site I've used a smooth-scrolling plugin from <a href="http://greensock.com/ScrollToPlugin" class="link" target="_blanck">GreenSock.com</a> to make it durrable and less buggy.</p>
