WalnutJS is an overlaying image viewer made with Vanilla JavaScript. It's responsive and the viewer is made for developers who needs a fast option, who don't want to put down a lot of time trying to figure out how it works.

Due to that, this plug-in could be a couple of extra kb then similar plug-ins. This is one of those projects I made because I wanted to know how it was done under the hood. But also, because I wasn't happy with other viewers. 

This plug-in is still in beta and I am constantly updating it to make it better before 1.0. So there could still be a lot of changes to the layout or functionality. But it also works now if you want to try it out.
