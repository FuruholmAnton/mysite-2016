It felt kinda liberating and I felt like I took a step towards a greener future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/gogreen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student I bought what organic I could afford. It&amp;rsquo;s still the same but with a job, I&amp;rsquo;m now able to buy much more. The stores have also increased the organic range of products which is really great. Some has even replaced some with only organic which is even better! I know that some people don&amp;rsquo;t feel like they can afford to buy organic, but you can also think of it as decreasing the chance of failing health in the future which could cost more then with all the medicin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like what&amp;rsquo;s the point, what difference does it make. When that happens I usually read some article about all chemicals that we get from the food or an article about how the chemicals sprayed on the crops later contaminates near lakes, streams etc. which means plants and animals gets affected by it and later us when we eat them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I want to say is be alert and critique both old and new thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
